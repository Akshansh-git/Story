Our skeleton consists of all our bones, teeth,
cartilage, and joints. Some bones protect our
internal organs. Some bones provide a
framework for the body (just as the spokes of an
umbrella provide a framework). Some bones
contain red marrow that produces blood cells and
yellow marrow that also stores fat.
