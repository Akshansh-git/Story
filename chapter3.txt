In order to increase its surface area, the
intestinal wall is folded, and each fold is lined
with villi. This way, more cells come into contact
with nutrients in the digested food. Nutrients
enter the epethelial cells that line the villi, either
by diffusion or active transport. They are then
absorbed by capillaries and lymph vessels.
Capillaries transport the nutrients to larger
blood vessels, then to the portal vein,which
goes to the liver. Then the nutrients go to the
heart, to be pumped to the rest of the body
